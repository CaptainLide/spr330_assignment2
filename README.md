# Attack #1: Mimikatz
I have included written instructions as well as a YouTube video explaining how to setup the environment for this attack. Originally I wanted to do this in an Active Directory but due to my current knowledge on properly setting up an Active Directory and presenting my knowledge on the attack tool. I decided it would be easier to show it off in a single machine that is isolated.
